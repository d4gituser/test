    "The goal of the second Portfolio task is to train linear regression models to predict users' ratings towards movies. This involves a standard Data Science workflow: exploring data, building models, making predictions, and evaluating results. In this task, we will explore the impacts of feature selections and different sizes of training/testing data on the model performance. We will continue using the movielens dataset provided in Portfolio task 1. "
